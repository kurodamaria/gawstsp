# gawstsp
A trivial implementation of genetic algorithm for solving STSP problems.

This project is for schoolwork demonstration purpose, it is not efficient enough to solve real STSP problems. However,
it could solve a STSP problem with city size less than 40 in a acceptable amount of time within a error range of 0.01% ~ 40%.
